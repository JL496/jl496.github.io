                      <p>Entomophobia's usually onsets before the age of 10. Most individuals don't recall the cause of their phobia or when it started. Phobias may come and go during childhood, but phobias that make it to adulthood are unlikely to go away.
                      <h3 class="mb-0">Trauma</h3>
                      <p>One of the most common causes of entomophobia is from suffering a traumatic experience involving an arthropod or observing a traumatic experience involving an arthropod. This may be something like being stung by a bee as a child.</p>
                      <h3 class="mb-0">Environment</h3>
                      <p>Being constantly warned about the dangers of arthropods can turn into a phobia. Other environmental risk factors are abuse, abandonment, and loss of a loved one as a child.</p>
                      <h3 class="mb-0">Genetics</h3>
                      <p>Individuals with a relative who has entomophobia or another phobia are more likely to develop entomophobia. Individuals who suffer from another phobia or anxiety disorder are also more likely to have entomophobia. Approximately 75% of individuals with a phobia have more than one.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-2 text-primary">Diagnosis</h2>
                <ol type = "A">
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">Visible fear about arthropods.</li>
                  <p>Visible fear may include panic attacks, rapid heart rate, tightness in the chest, hyperventilating, sweating, or shaking. In children, visible fear can include crying or staying close to a parent. The fear must be caused by the arthropod and must be severe to qualify for diagnosis, but may vary given the circumstances.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">Arthropods almost always cause fear immediately.</li>
                  <p>The individual must experience fear almost every time they encounter an arthropod. An individual who only experiences fear occasionally does not qualify for diagnosis. The fear should also start as soon as the individual encounters the arthropod.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">Arthropods are actively avoided or are met with intense fear.</li>
                  <p>The individual tries to avoid situations where arthropods are present or if unable to avoid the situation experiences extreme fear. This may be avoiding being outdoors or areas where arthropods are more common like basements.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">The amount of fear is unreasonable given the actual danger of the arthropod in context.</li>
                  <p>Some arthropods are dangerous and some level of fear is normal, but a large amount of fear with a low amount of danger qualifies for diagnosis. While those who experience entomophobia are typically aware that they are overly fearful of arthropods, they also tend to overestimate the actual fear of arthropods.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">The fear is continuous, typically lasting at least 6 months.</li>
                  <p>The duration requirement is meant to differentiate between common temporary fears and long lasting phobias especially in children. This is a guideline and a diagnosis may be made when the fear has not existed for 6 months.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">The fear causes serious distress or impairment in everyday life.</li>
                  <p>The phobia should cause problems in the individual's work life, social life, or important aspects of their everyday life in order to qualify for diagnosis.</p>
                  <li class = "fs-4 fw-bold text-black">The phobia is not explained better by another mental disorder.</li>
                  <p>In cases where the phobia is better explained by another mental disorder such as posttraumatic stress disorder or an anxiety disorder, that should be diagnosed instead.</p>

            <div class="sec-content">
                <h2 class="mb-2 text-primary">Treatments</h2>
                <p>Entomophobia is typically treated with therapy. Different therapy techniques may be used to treat the phobia and the mental health professional may recommend other treatments outside of therapy.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-2 text-secondary">Types of Therapy</h3>
                <h4 class="mb-0">Exposure Therapy</h4>
                <p>Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing the patient to arthropods in a safe setting and trying to change the response to them. This usually starts with simply talking about arthropods and then progresses into viewing media of insects. Patients may then be brought into a room with an arthropod in a clear container and each week progressing closer to the arthropod.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-0">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h4>
                <p>CBT combines exposure with learning techniques to handle the fear. CBT teaches the patient to control their feelings and change how they think about arthropods. This prevents the patient from feeling overwhelmed in fearful situations.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-2 text-secondary">Other Treatments</h3>
                <h4 class="mb-0">Medication</h4>
                <p>Generally, therapy alone is enough to treat entomophobia, but in some cases medication may be prescribed to reduce anxiety.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-0">Support Groups</h4>
                <p>Support groups may help patients know they're not alone and allow them to connect with other people who know what they're going through.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-0">Relaxation Techniques</h4>
                <p>Relaxation techniques such as controlled breathing and meditation may be taught in order to cope with anxiety.</p>

                <p>Salvador Dali suffered from entomophobia and had an extreme fear of grasshoppers.
                  Insects made appearances in several of his art pieces as seen above.
                  When he was 22, he was convinced that a mole on his back was a bed bug or tick.
                  Thus, he went to the bathroom and tried to pull it off. When he was unsuccessful,
                  he resorted to cutting it off with a razor blade.</p>
